# A generative garden teeming with 'succulent' plants. 

In reality, they only remotely resemble succulents with the right parameters. Otherwise you get alien / mutant looking plants.

This was a silly WebGL experiment that's slowly evolved into an application for VJ performance. As a result, the code is a complete mess as this was never intended to turn into what it has. I've just been hacking it together here and there in spare time, and it's in much need of a HUGE refactor / application architecture overhaul.

Since this is for VJ'ing, it has some specific things like support for the APC40 MIDI controller, and a custom TouchOSC virtual MIDI controller. (The layout is in the repo under TouchOSC presets)

It's very, very likely that this repo is COMPLETELY useless to you as it's so specific to my use case, but maybe there is something interesting here for you.
