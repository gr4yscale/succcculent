** Physical interactions with the succulents
    3d print plants, experiment with materials that let us bend leaves as control surfaces
    Experiment with light and shadows on plants as a control surface
    Lighting, DMX, computer vision, machine learning, evolutionary algorithms



** What are some possibilities of hardware interactions with the system?
    Interactive installations, physical interfaces, interaction with 3D environments



** Short biography about me

  I like doing experimental things with software and hardware.

  My focus areas for the next little while are: machine learning, artificial intelligence, generative algorithms, and virtual / augmented reality.

  I'm always building and making:

  interactive web-based graphics things
  native mobile & desktop applications
  web-based applications (server + client-side)
  embedded / hardware-based things




** Project description



** Residence selection:
  -Why am I choosing this residence?
    -Interested in the Fablab in particular
    -LEV: one of my close friends said great things about the festival this year
    -Mention interest in hardware and electronics
    -An AV Research lab + FABLab would be more fitting as I would prefer to create a system that an audience can participate with
    -Feel more comfortable with this than to integrate my project into a performance setting

Production plan:
  -Technical requirements: equipment, software, technical support
  -Timeline for 2 weeks
  -Budget
