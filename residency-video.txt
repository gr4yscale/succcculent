Live visuals performance software
Garden of succulent plants
Started as an experiment where I rendered one succulent plant, began extending it
WebGL-based, but routes video frames through Syphon + CEF in C++
Work in progress
Has scene selection and camera controls
Generative, but parameters and camera positions can be saved
Takes inputs from other systems via OSC/MIDI
Routes video output through Syphon
Camera controls (position + angle)
Camera presets (you can record position + angles as hotkeys and play back later)



So far it is just a visual thing.
I would like to experiment and couple it with a sound component which is fitting for the aesthetics.
Want to do some things like manipulate geometry in realtime (morph the angle of petals in response to audio, for example)



Digital fabrication:

Large plants as control surfaces
Recreate the generative function that produced geometry
Algorithmic Beauty of Plants
Using light as a control parameter - plant sensing light
Acceleration / motion, light
Petals flexible, detect amount of bend and feed it to parameters

I have experience working with small AVR and ARM-based microcontrollers (teensy, arduino, discovery), am comfortable with the electronics side of things



Residency, why I chose:

LEV: one of my friends said great things about the festival this year
Interested in the Fablab in particular
Want artistic direction and people to collaborate and share ideas with

An AV Research lab + FABLab would be more fitting as I would prefer to create a system that an audience can participate with
Feel more comfortable with this than to integrate my project into a performance setting
